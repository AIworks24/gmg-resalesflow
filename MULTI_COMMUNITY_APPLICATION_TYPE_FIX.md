# Multi-Community Application Type Persistence Fix

## üêõ **Problem Identified**

After completing the property inspection form for the primary property in a multi-community application, the modal was incorrectly switching to a "standard application" view with only one property task, instead of maintaining the multi-community workflow with all linked properties.

## üîç **Root Cause**

The issue was in multiple database queries throughout the application that were **missing the `is_multi_community` field** from the `hoa_properties` table. When the application data was refreshed after form completion, the multi-community context was lost because this crucial field wasn't being fetched.

### **Specific Issues Found:**

1. **`refreshSelectedApplication` function** in `AdminApplications.js` - Missing `is_multi_community`
2. **`loadFormData` function** in `AdminApplications.js` - Missing `is_multi_community`
3. **AdminDashboard.js** - Multiple queries missing `is_multi_community`
4. **Inspection form page** - Missing `is_multi_community`
5. **Resale form page** - Missing `is_multi_community`
6. **applicationsApi.js** - Missing `is_multi_community`

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied**

Updated all database queries to include the `is_multi_community` field from the `hoa_properties` table:

### **Before:**
```sql
hoa_properties(name, property_owner_email, property_owner_name)
```

### **After:**
```sql
hoa_properties(name, property_owner_email, property_owner_name, is_multi_community)
```

## üìÅ **Files Fixed**

1. **`components/admin/AdminApplications.js`**
   - `refreshSelectedApplication` function (line 763)
   - `loadFormData` function (line 677)

2. **`components/admin/AdminDashboard.js`**
   - Multiple queries updated (lines 233, 536, 637)

3. **`pages/admin/inspection/[applicationId].js`**
   - Application data query (line 58)

4. **`pages/admin/resale/[applicationId].js`**
   - Application data query (line 56)

5. **`lib/api/applicationsApi.js`**
   - Multiple queries updated (lines 64, 97)

## üéØ **Expected Result**

Now when a user completes the property inspection form for the primary property in a multi-community application:

1. ‚úÖ **Multi-community context is preserved** after form completion
2. ‚úÖ **All linked properties remain visible** in the task view
3. ‚úÖ **Application type stays as "multi-community"** instead of switching to "standard"
4. ‚úÖ **Property groups continue to show** all associated properties
5. ‚úÖ **Workflow continues correctly** for remaining properties

## üß™ **Testing**

To test this fix:

1. **Create a multi-community application** with linked properties
2. **Complete the inspection form** for the primary property
3. **Verify the modal maintains** the multi-community view
4. **Confirm all linked properties** are still visible
5. **Check that the application type** remains "multi-community"

The fix ensures that the multi-community application workflow is maintained throughout the entire process, preventing the incorrect fallback to single-property view.
